    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Congee is a porridge made by cooking rice in more water than usual for longer than usual. It's a 
        very comforting and nutritious dish, perfect for weekly meal prep and ripe for a variety of 
        toppings.
    </p>
    <p>This version starts with breaking down a whole chicken to make chicken broth and incorporating
        the chicken meat as a source of protein. Suggested toppings are listed in the 'Tips and Tricks' section.
